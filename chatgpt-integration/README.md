# Harnessing the Power of AI!

## Um, what?

This directory houses the relevant API files for integration of ChatGPT for TBD use. Initially, it may be used to process the .json game archives one can download from their casino provider while alternatively, with more familiarity, we may hope to connect ChatGPT directly with a certain casino's API to provide real-time analyzation of live game data to track game results, player strategy, and/or assisted outcome prediction. These are just big hopes and dreams though as we lack sufficient knowledge at the moment to approach this more seriously, so for now, consider it a simple reference to future projects and don;'t expect anything.
