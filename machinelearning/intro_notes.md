## Using Machine Learning to Make Predictions Using Data
As a subset of AI, machine learning distinguishes itself from AI in that its goal is not to enable computers and machines to perform human-like tasks but rather is used to solve problems and make predictions from data. Notably, Data Science is a field that attempts to find patterns and draw insights from data.


### A Multi-Faceted Approach
Using different types of machine learning as well as different forms of data expands our "looking glass", sort of speak, in determining any potential method(s) of identifying or recognizing any sort of pattern. Data itself is divided into two main categories, the raw hash data and the visual perceived data.
Whereas:
 - The Raw Hash Data is the game output has itself, the HMAC-SHA256 output of the combined server seed, client seed, and nonce serving as the game hash that is used for determining a game result. (Unsupervised Learning)
 - The Visual Perceved Data will be the visual appearance of a game outcome, using visual elements to find potential patterns in the visual representation of a game outcome, such as Diamonds, Mines, Keno, or etc. (Supervised Learning)
