  # Interplay Between Randomness and Determinism

While cryptographic hashing is generally used to generate seemingly random output from deterministic inputs (resulting in seemingly random casino game outcomes), in this repository we explore the reverse scenario: taking random inputs and generating deterministic or orderly outputs.

## Areas of Study

It's worth noting that while some of these concepts involve extracting patterns or order from randomness, they don't necessarily reverse the process of cryptographic hashing or provide ways to predict the original input. Cryptographic hash functions are designed to be one-way and secure against such reverse-engineering attempts so we don't bother with that. We take the subjectively more realistic route of using creative methods for determining a pattern among game results in order to increase our edge against the casino ever so slightly and recognize we may be disilusioned or dehydrated. However, exploring the connections between randomness and determinism in various fields of study can provide valuable insights into the nature of data, information, and the interplay between order and randomness.

 - **Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs):** In some ways, PRNGs bridge the gap between randomness and determinism. They take a seed (often an initial value) and use deterministic algorithms to generate sequences of numbers that appear random but are determined by the seed. PRNGs are often used in simulations and games like online casino games.

 - **Noise Reduction and Signal Processing:** In signal processing, noise reduction techniques are used to extract meaningful signals from noisy data. Algorithms are applied to reduce randomness and extract underlying patterns or trends.

 - **Data Compression and Encoding:** Techniques like data compression and encoding involve transforming data into more compact or structured forms. While these techniques don't necessarily reverse randomness, they aim to extract patterns from data.

 - **Randomness Extractors:** These are algorithms designed to extract randomness from a random source with less randomness but with some amount of initial structure. They are used to ensure that the extracted output is close to uniformly random.

 - **Entropy Coding:** Entropy coding techniques are used in data compression to assign shorter codes to more probable events. This involves extracting patterns or probabilities from data to achieve more efficient encoding.

 - **Chaos Theory:** Chaos theory explores deterministic systems that can exhibit complex, seemingly random behavior. While chaos doesn't directly reverse randomness, it showcases how deterministic systems can produce unpredictable outcomes.

 - **Random Graph Theory:** This area studies properties of random graphs and their structural patterns, providing insights into the relationships between randomness and order in network structures.

 - **Quantum Randomness Extraction:** Quantum cryptography involves extracting random bits from quantum processes. While this may not be directly related to our concept of "pattern finding", it does involve the idea of generating order from quantum randomness. Also, we would need to find someone with a quantum computer, know anyone?
